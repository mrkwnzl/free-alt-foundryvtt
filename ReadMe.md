Some modules use the Alt key for some key bindings, but the Alt key highlights all tokens on the canvas, which can be a bit distracting when using these modules and also hit the performance when there are lots of tokens on the canvas. This module adds a client-side setting that re-maps highlighting all tokens on the canvas from Alt to H, thus freeing Alt.

**Note:** It’s not enough to activate this module. You also have to enable the settings in the Module Settings in order for them to take effect. This is because as a client-side setting (that is each player can set it up to personal preference) I thought it would be best to default to the default Foundry behavior. There is also a setting to apply Free Alt to all clients, which will disable the client-side setting.
